        "Our common welfare should come first; personal recovery depends upon C.A. unity.",

        "The only requirement for C.A. membership is a desire to stop using cocaine and all other mind-altering substances.",
        "Each group should be autonomous except in matters affecting other groups or C.A. as a whole.",
        "Each group has but one primary purpose, to carry its message to the addict who still suffers.",
        "A C.A. group ought never endorse, finance, or lend the C.A. name to any related facility or outside enterprise, lest problems of money, property and prestige divert us from our primary purpose.",
        "Every C.A. group ought to be fully self-supporting, declining outside contributions.",
        "Cocaine Anonymous should remain forever non-professional, but our service centers may employ special workers.",
        "C.A., as such, ought never be organized; but we may create service boards or committees directly responsible to those they serve.",
        "Cocaine Anonymous has no opinion on outside issues; hence the C.A. name ought never be drawn into public controversy.",
        "Our public relations policy is based on attraction rather than promotion; we need always maintain personal anonymity at the level of press, radio, television and films.",
        "Anonymity is the spiritual foundation of all our Traditions, ever reminding us to place principles before personalities.",
